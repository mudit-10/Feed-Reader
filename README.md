## Feed-Reader
Feed-Reader is an Android App which reads the RSS feed(written in XML) from a blogging website through *Retrofit* <br>
and displays it in list views arranged in various tabs. Each tab represents a different tag of the website. Fragments have been used alongwith viewpager, with the help of *FragmentPagerAdapter*. The coordinator layout has been used to give the effect of a collapsing toolbar. *JSoup* has been used to handle the html content of the website included in one of the tags of the XML. <br>
Multithreading has been used in fetching data into the different fragments.
